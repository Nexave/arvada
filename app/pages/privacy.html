                    the data entered into the system. Due to the fact that the system is available via the Internet, it

                <p>
                    Make sure that HTTPS appears on the browser bar. When connecting to a secure site, the address
                    displayed in the browser should start with the letters: https://, instead of the arwada west family:
                    http://.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also pay attention to the status bar of the browser window (lower right corner of the screen). If
                    there is a closed padlock icon, it means a secure encryption using SSL algorithm.
