                </h2>
                <p>
                    We comply with all applicable regulations relating to personal data protection (“Applicable
                    regulation“), and in particular all provisions defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European
                    Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (the “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR“),
                    as well as the provisions of the French law n°78-17 of February 6, 1978, called “Informatique et
                    Libertés” modified (the “LIL“). Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
                    person constitutes “Personal Data” within the meaning of the GDPR. An identifiable natural person is
                    a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
                    identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one
                    or more elements specific to his or her physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic,
                    cultural or social identity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We hereby wish to inform you how we process and protect your Personal Data collected and controlled
                    by Mobility Work on the Mobility Work Platform, including Personal Data collected on the Maintenance
                    Management Application and the Hub Application.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is specified that the terms “you”, “your” or “yours” as used in these terms refer to any natural
                    person who is a Client or User of Mobility Work.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In the context of the execution of the contracts between Mobility Work and its Clients, and in
                    particular under the terms and conditions of the General Terms and Conditions of Use of the
                    Maintenance Management Application and the General Terms and Conditions of Use of the Hub
                    Application (together referred to herein as the “General Terms of Use”), and of all other policies,
                    conditions and agreements applicable according to the Services provided to the Client, the Client
                    may also be responsible for the collection and processing of certain Personal Data of its Users. It
                    is then incumbent on the Client to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions, and
                    in particular the regulations applicable to the protection of personal data, and to obtain any prior
                    authorizations. The Client in this case must guarantee that it has all the rights necessary to
                    collect and process the Personal Data of its Users and it is the Client’s responsibility to inform
                    and guarantee all the rights of its Users in application of the Applicable Regulations. For all
                    purposes, it is recalled that the data controller is, in accordance with the applicable legislation,
                    the entity that defines and limits the data to be collected and the purposes of processing. Mobility
                    Work may, depending on the case, act as a busprocessor of the Client, or as a separate data
                    controller.
