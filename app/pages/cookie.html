                    for using the Website. Cookies typically include the name of the website they came from, the time
                    they were stored on the device, and a unique number.

                    A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or
                    mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over
                    time.<br>
                    Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them
                    whenever they like.

                </p>
                <h2>Can I control or delete Cookie files?</h2>
                <p>
                    In many cases, web browsing software (web browser) allows you to store Cookies files on your device
                    by default. The Users of the Website may change the Cookie settings at any time. These settings may
                    be changed in such a way, as to block the automatic Cookie files support in the web browser, or to
                    inform the User each time about storing them on the User’s device. Detailed information on Cookies
                    support is available in the software settings (web browser). Please refer to your browser’s
                    instructions or help, to learn how to customise or change your browser settings. If you block the
                    Cookies we use, this may result in the lower quality of arwada west, for example, visiting certain
                    areas of our website will not be available or you will not receive personalised information while
                    browsing. If you use different devices to browse arwada west (e.g. computer, tablet or smartphone)
                    you need to make sure that each browser on each device is set according to your preferences.
